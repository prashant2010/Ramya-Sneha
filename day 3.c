#include <stdio.h>
void main()
{
    int int1, int2;
 
    printf("Input the values for Number1 and Number2 : ");
    scanf("%d %d", &int1, &int2);

Questions:
What is the structure of a program?
defination
global declaration of variables
main()
declaration section 
sub program
What is the difference between %d and %f format specifiers?
%d used for integer data type and %f is used for float data type
What is a function?
A function is a group of statements that together perform a task.
What is a function definition?
A function definition provides the actual body of the function
What is a function declaration?
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters.
Why do you need function declaration?
to tell the compiler about the function name,its return type nad the parameters if passed to the function
What are the formal parameters?
The term parameter (sometimes called formal parameter) is often used to refer to the variable as found in the function definition,
What are the actual parameters?
argument (sometimes called actual parameter) refers to the actual input supplied at function call.
What is the meaning of pass by value?
The call by value method of passing arguments to a function copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function
What is the meaning of pass by reference?
Passing by reference means that the memory address of the variable (a pointer to the memory location) is passed to the function
What is the meaning of floating point number?
The term floating point is means the fact that there is no fixed number of digits before and after the decimal point; that is, the decimal point can float.
