It is a header file which contains all the input and output functions like printf and scanf.
printf is a function in c used to print the "character,string,float,integer,octal and hexadecimal values" onto the output screen.
main() is a function used to define a function that takes no arguments.
 variables are used to store information to be referenced and used by programs.
 There are five basic data types associated with variables:
int - integer: a whole number.
float - floating point value: ie a number with a fractional part.
double - a double-precision floating point value.
char - a single character.
void - valueless special purpose type which we will examine closely in later sections.
 An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand.
 The first argument to printf is a string of identifiers. %s refers to a string %d refers to an integer %c refers to a character
 A compiler is a special program that processes statements written in a particular programming language and turns them into machine language or "code" that a computer's processor uses.
 meaning of both "to run" and "to execute" refers to the specific action of a user starting (or launching or invoking) a program, as in "Please run the application."
 Open the computerâ€™s code and compile program.
Locate the manual debugging tool by looking on the toolbar.
Look under the Tool tab and search for Debug or Debug compiler.
Click result found.
Review the code for errors.
Fix all errors you find.
Save all changes then run the compiler.
Restart your computer when the process is complete.
